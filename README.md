# Relay-Shield
Shield for Arduino Nano with 6 relay controlled by a real time clock module

Arduino Conde Line used for turn on and turn off based on time captured from RTC and analogs systems response


--  Shield:
    Powered by a 9V DC source;
    Voltage regulator to 5V DC;
    Pin outs for analog entrance;

    Digital Signal for relays:
        Relay 1: D12;
        Relag 2: D11;
        Relay 3: D5;
        Relay 4: D4;
        Relay 5: D3;
        Relay 6: D2;

    Real Time Clock (RTC):
    Pintouts:
        DS:  A6;
        SCL: A5 (SCL for arduino);
        SDA: A4 (SDA for arduino);
  
  Analog bus of pinouts: A0, A1, A2, A3, A7;
